        "Despite its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression one. It's a fundamental supervised learning method used to predict the probability that an input belongs to a specific category.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its most common use is for binary classification, where there are only two possible outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, 1/0, True/False, Spam/Not Spam).\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is to take a set of input features and output a probability value between 0 and 1. This probability is then used to make a final classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of this function is the probability that the input belongs to \"Class 1\". If the output is 0.8, it means there's an 80% probability of it being Class 1. If the output is 0.1, it means there's a 10% probability of it being Class 1. Finally, a decision threshold (usually 0.5) is used to make the final call: If Probability 16 >= 0.5, predict Class 1. If Probability 18 < 0.5, predict Class 0."
